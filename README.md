## Description

This technical course covers the core Docker and Kubernetes concepts and guides you to build containers. Developers, DevOps, SREs and I.T. Pros will learn how to use containers locally. You’ll experience several demos and hands-on exercises throughout the course as you learn how to build and deploy containers.
